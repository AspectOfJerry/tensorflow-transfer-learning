# Installation

- Recommended Python version: 3.9
- Resources:
    - [Youtube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/rRwflsS67ow?list=PLAs-3cqyNbIjqaTLHNSu2g4kpaw6TGCud)
    - [Tensorflow Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md)

### Clone Tensorflow Models repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
```

### Install Protobuf

<https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases>

Download the corresponding version of protobuf for your system and extract it to a folder (`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\`). Then, add the bin
folder to your PATH environment variable (`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\protoc-25.1-win64\bin`).

Restart your IDE/terminal and follow the next steps.

### Run protoc

Copy the `use_protobuf.py` file to the `models/research` folder and run the following command:

```bash
cd models/research  (if not already in the folder)
python use_protobuf.py object_detection/protos protoc
```

### Copying files

Copy the `setup.py` file from `models/research/object_detection/packages/tf2` to `models/research/` and run the following command:

```bash
cd models/research  (if not already in the folder)
python -m pip install .
```

Reinstall `numpy` because the included version is somehow broken:

```bash
pip install numpy==1.24.3 --force-reinstall
```

### Fix protobuf error

If you test the installation now, you will get the following error:

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:<...>\tensorflow-transfer-learning\models\research\object_detection\builders\model_builder_tf2_test.py", line 24, in <module>
    from object_detection.builders import model_builder
  File "C:<...>\tensorflow-transfer-learning\venv\lib\site-packages\object_detection\builders\model_builder.py", line 23, in <module>
    from object_detection.builders import anchor_generator_builder
  File "C:<...>\tensorflow-transfer-learning\venv\lib\site-packages\object_detection\builders\anchor_generator_builder.py", line 26, in <module>
    from object_detection.protos import anchor_generator_pb2
  File "C:<...>\tensorflow-transfer-learning\venv\lib\site-packages\object_detection\protos\anchor_generator_pb2.py", line 9, in <module>
    from google.protobuf.internal import builder as _builder
ImportError: cannot import name 'builder' from 'google.protobuf.internal' (C:<...>\tensorflow-transfer-learning\venv\lib\site-packages\google\protobuf\internal\__init__.py)
```

Here's a fix from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71759248/importerror-cannot-import-name-builder-from-google-protobuf-internal)

1. Install the latest protobuf version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade protobuf
```

2. Copy the `builder.py` file from `...\Lib\site-packages\google\protobuf\internal` to another folder (e.g. your desktop).
3. Re-install protobuf:

```bash
pip install protobuf==3.19.6 --force-reinstall
```

4. Copy the `builder.py` file back to `...\Lib\site-packages\google\protobuf\internal` and replace the existing file.

### Test the installation

```
cd models/research/object_detection/builders  (if not already in the folder)
python model_builder_tf2_test.py
```

You should get the following output:

```
[...]

Ran 24 tests in 13.296s

OK (skipped=1)
```

And you're done (for this part) ðŸŽ‰!

# Setup

### Download the model

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install wget
```

Copy the `model_downloader.py` file to the `models/research/object_detection` folder and run the following command:

```bash
cd models/research/object_detection  (if not already in the folder)
python model_downloader.py
```

You should see a folder with the model's name in the `models/research/object_detection` folder.

### (Optional) Choose a different model

Visit the [Tensorflow Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md)

Change the `MODEL_FILE` variable in the `model_downloader.py` file to the model you want to use. Make sure to double-check the URL.

## Test the model

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

If not already installed (`pip list`), install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-python-headless
```

For all the following commands, replace:

- the `-m` parameter with the name of the model you downloaded if you chose a different model.
- the `-l` parameter with the path to the label map file of the model you downloaded if you chose a different model.

### Predict on the included test images

Copy the `predict_image.py` file to the `models/research/object_detection` folder and run the following command:

```bash
cd models/research/object_detection  (if not already in the folder)
python .\predict_image.py -m ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_320x320_coco17_tpu-8\saved_model -l .\data\mscoco_label_map.pbtxt -i .\test_images
```

The output should be in the `models/research/object_detection/output` folder.

### Predict on webcam

Copy the `predict_webcam.py` file to the `models/research/object_detection` folder and run the following command:

```bash
cd models/research/object_detection  (if not already in the folder)
python .\predict_webcam.py -m ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_320x320_coco17_tpu-8\saved_model -l .\data\mscoco_label_map.pbtxt
```

### Predict on a video

Copy the `predict_video.py` file to the `models/research/object_detection` folder and run the following command:
Replace `video.mp4` with the name of the video you want to use.
Move your video to the `models/research/object_detection` folder.

```bash
cd models/research/object_detection  (if not already in the folder)
python .\predict_video.py -m ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_320x320_coco17_tpu-8\saved_model -l .\data\mscoco_label_map.pbtxt -v .\video.mp4
```

And you're done (for this part) ðŸŽ‰!

# Custom model/transfer learning

### Prepare the dataset

Create a folder called `images` in the `models/research/object_detection` folder. Then, copy the custom dataset's `test` and `train` folders into the `images`
folder.

### Convert XML to CSV

Copy the `xml_to_csv.py` file to the `models/research/object_detection` folder and run the following command:

```
cd models/research/object_detection  (if not already in the folder)
python xml_to_csv.py
```
